11 Comment [Ill: This is the only
text in this document which is
added manually.
Comment [121: This shows the
start of an eaDocX Section'. It is
not visible in the final document,
as it's text styte is 'invisible'. [t can
be see here because we have
chosen the Word option to 'show
invisible text'.
Comment [131: This section is a
'Document Information' one. [t is
refreshed each time the document
is generated, so it is always up-to-
date
Some of the information is created
as the document is generated,
some is stored in eaDocX, and
some comes from the Word
document's properties.
As with all eaDocX sections, what
appears here is configurable.
Comment [141: This is the end
of the eaDocX section.
Any text which you add after this
point will NOT be overwritten
when the document is re-

1 Project background (c) eaDocX Ltd 2012
This section has some general information about the project - why we're doing it, who our main
competitors witl be, and the main people who are involved plus their rotes.
Contains:
• Intro text
• Organisation
• Competitor
31 Comment [161: We have
chosen to start this section with a
Heading Level 1. This is
configurable. There is a page
break before this heading, as
that's what the Heading 1 Word
style says.
eaDocX uses the Word style to
determine the detailed formatting
of most of the document: the
colour of text, font, size,
positioning etc.
So, the generated text can look
exactly the same as the manually
created content: this makes the
document look professional, and is
easier to read.
Comment [171: This text has
come from our EA model.
We keep even textual content tike
this in EA, because we've found
that it's reused in many
documents, so we have just lots of
background information, which
gets used in many documents.(eaDocXl

1.1 [Introduction]
is a new way to organize and book travel.
GetLost 'M (c) eaDocX Ltd 2012
Today, there are hundreds of websites offering to book just flights, or just trains, or just cars. A few
witl let the customer book a flight AND a hotel. But most customers don't want to travel from an
airport to another airport - they want to travel from home to their destination - an office, or a beach.
GetLost 'M allows them to do this. They tell the system where they want to start, where they want to
finish, and some options. GetLost 'M will then give them options, based on the customers chosen
criteria.
For example:
• Starting at Bath, UK
• Ending at a hotel near the Arc de Triomphe, [Parisl
• Staying - 2 nights in a 3* hotel
Get Lost might produce:
Option 1: Cheapest:
1. Car from home to London, Heathrow (estimate GBP 34.00)
2. Park in Business Parking - GBP 45.00
3. Flight LHG-CDG- 234.00
4. Metro CDG -Paris-GBP 12.00
5. Hotel Le France, 1 person, 2 nights, half board GBP 240.001
Option 2: Greenest Comment [181: Another page
break here, because the Word
Document Heading 2 Styte also is
configured for •page Break before'.
Comment [191: Bullet points
within text can use their own
Word Styte. In this case, we've
chosen one which makes the text
quite compact, and indented. All
this is configured in Word.
Comment [110]: Numbered
lists can atso use their own Word

6. Bus from (home) to Bath railway station *
Train to London Paddington

Hotel Le France, 1 person, 2 nights, hatf board GBP 240.00
- not sure yet how we will express the 'green-ness of each part of the journey: either tonnes of
C02, or perhaps a simpler 'starring' system: 5* very green, 1* = not.
Option 3: Fastest
...etc
For each leg of the journey, the customer will be able to ask for other alternatives e.g. Taxi from
home to the train station.
Business Case
Like other travel aggregators, GetLost will make a margin on each journey booked, which will be
enhanced by doing deals with specific providers who will give us discounts, which we may pass on
part of to the customer.
GetLost 'M is made possible by two recent innovations:
41(eaDocXl
document excellence (c) eaDocX Ltd 2012
1 - A unique, patented piece of software TravelOptimizer'M - that compares modes of transport to
produce the best customer solution. It's a bit tike the travel directions software that motoring
companies use, except multi-modal.
"Best" can be based on
• Cheapest
• Fastest
Lowest carbon-footprint
This is not where we witl make the money (quotes are free) — the profit comes from the commissions
on booking hotets etc, but the multi-model quote is what we believe will make people keep using
the site, especially the carbon footprint feature. TravelOptimizer keeps a database of maps, travel
routes, possible costs (not quotes, just general rates for typical journeys) from many TBML suppliers.
2. A new XML.based international standard for exchange of travel information & quotes and
payment of fees: TBML, managed by TBMt.Co. This makes integrating new travel service suppliers a
simple, non-lT process, removing the need for aggregators like SABRE or AMADEUS. TBML requires
the following steps:
"Establish" where the parties exchange information about fees etc. Fees are set by the TBML
standards committee: only a supplier that wants to charge fees outside of that requires
manual intervention
"Quote" — info from requester to supplier, with details of what's needed. Fee payable by
requester. Details of travel returned to requester.
"Book" — as Quote, but with a booking ref, and larger fees payable.
"Settle" — where suppliers & requestors get billed & paid by the TBML organisation.

first diagram which we have
added.
We can choose to leave-out
diagrams which are not suitable
for our document in several ways:
- diagrams which should never be
printed in any document (because
they are just scratch diagrams) can
be flagged this way in EA
- For alt other diagrams, we can
choose to exclude any diagram
individually from a specific

We have kept the EA frame

etements,
which we have chosen to be
printed in a list.
Each element gets a row in the
tabte, and we can choose which
attributes appear in which
columns, and the headings of
those cotumns.
Comment [113]: This row is
highlighted, because this
document is using eaDocX Change
Marking.
This examines the •tast updated'
date/time of each element,
wherever it is printed, and
highlights those which have been
changed since a specified date.
This makes it much easier for
readers to go straight to the
newest part of a document.
[t's not as detailed as Word
change-marking - the reader can't
see exactly which text was
changed - but alt the information
does come from the EA model, so
may have changes made by many
people.
Comment [114]: This is a
cross-reference within the EA
model, where one element
references another one.
eaDocX has made this into a
hyperlinked cross-reference within
the document.
Comment [115]: The data in
this column comes not from
attributes of the Actor, but from
another element which is related
to the Actor - in this case, a
related Requirement.
This makes those EA relationships
visibte in the document, because
they are really important.
If the target of the relationship
(the Requirements, in this case)
are also printed in this document,
then this becomes a hyperlink.(eaDocXl

91 2010, 2012 2013 Comment [117]: [n this EA
Package, there are some
elements.
We used these to capture some
information about competitors,
and stereotyping 'Actor' seemed a
sensible way to do it.
As we have quite a tot to say
about competitors, we have
chosen to print information about
them as intine paragraphs, rather
than as rows in the table.
Comment [118]: This gives
each its own
heading. We've also chosen to
print the stereotype of the
etement in the heading, just to
remind us that we're looking at
competitor information. This is
configurable.
Comment [119]: Although
each element has its own heading,
we can still use littte tabtes of
attributes. These tables always
have just one row of data, and a
heading, as they are showing just
information from a single element.
This is useful where we want to
show lots of attributes of the
etements, each of which has just a
small amount of data.
These can also use a Word Table
Style. We have chosen one which
looks like the one we used above,
with the same shading on the
header row.
Comment [120]: This is
another reason to print
as inline
paragraphs - we can configure
them to always print any diagrams
which are children of the element.
eaDocX adds the Fgure number
(the word' figure' is configurable)
so you can print a Table of Figures,
just like a normal Word document.(eaDocXl

the UK. Comment [121]: Another
section. The names of sections can
be changed, to remind us what
should be printed there, but as
they are invisibte in the final

2 Initial [Requirements
Ill (c) eaDocX Ltd 2012 Comment [122]: Sometimes
having two Word headings, both
of which throw a page break,
causes btank pages - but that's
always been a challenge for
writers of Word documents.
If this EA Package had some notes,
then they would print here.
[n our models, we have a standard
that ALL packages ALWAYS have
some notes, even if it just says
•these are the initial
requirements'. [t makes the
document more readable, but
more important, it makes the
MODEt_ more readable, which is
important. 30th for you, later on
in the project when you have
forgotten where the information
came from, or for other model
users.(eaDocXl

We don't HAVE to make each

eaDocX can print EA Structured

Each scenario is a separate tabte
of steps (we could have printed
them as separate paragraphs, but
we thought a table looked neater)
Comment [129]: Where the
scenario has alternates and
exceptions, eaDocX automatically
creates hyperlinks to those.
This means your EA model can use
the full power of EA Structured
Scenarios, and the document can
show alt the [inks which you

where the Alternate path rejoins
the main path, that also becomes
a hyperlink.
